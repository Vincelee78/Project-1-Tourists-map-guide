Project 1

Unused code:

Alternative code for locating current location:
// let currentLocation = map_object.attributionControl['_map']['_lastCenter']
// let currentLat = currentLocation['lat']
// let currentLng = currentLocation['lng']
// let currentCoordinates=(currentLat,currentLng)
// let currentmarker = L.marker(currentCoordinates)
// currentmarker.addTo(map)

Alternative code for refreshing taxi coordinates:
// Refresh the page every 5 minutes to get latest taxi locations
// setTimeout("location.reload();", 300000)

Code for flying to taxi coordinates markers:
// marker.addEventListener('click', function () {
    //   map.flyTo(actualcoordinates, 15)
    // })

PROJECT NAME AND SUMMARY

Project name: Interactive map guide for tourists in Singapore.

Summary: To allow tourists to locate nearby hotels, eateries, hawkers, attractions from their current location and display real time taxi availability.

My goal/Motivation for creating this project: To provide tourists an one stop map guide for locations around Singapore.

Context: Many of my overseas friends have commmented that Singapore is small and there is nothing to do here after a day. I created this map guide to encourage tourists to spend more time in Singapore and explore all the attractions and events even with the current COVID situation. Thus, they will spend more and boost the local economy from tourism spending.

Demo: A live website server can be found on the Gitpod server.
